The most interesting part of this workshop and lecture is being familiarized with built-in functions 
named ignore, width, setf, unsetf which I essentially used in this workshop and these let me organized 
my lines and design my table.
Also, I used classes instead of structs and define variables as a private and some required functions 
as a public members of the class. I used dynamic memory by allocating memory to my class object and 
at the end deallocate memory to avoid memory leap. I tried to use more of flags specially in my functions
which are bool so i would be more easy to retrieve dta from my function.
The most challenging part for me is the part that we should allocate memory dynamically, I did not recognize 
where should I allocate memory and how can I notice that it is a right place and right thing that I am 
allocating memory to.
